# SPT-Txn — Privacy-Preserving Compliance & Travel Rule Authorization (Reference POC)

[![CI](https://github.com/rudizee007/spt-txn-poc/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rudizee007/spt-txn-poc/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
&nbsp;Apache-2.0 · Go 1.25 / gnark v0.15 · OpenBSD · live demo: <https://foss.violetskysecurity.com>

SPT-Txn verifies compliance **once** and proves it **everywhere**, in zero
knowledge — so regulated institutions and VASPs can transact, tokenise, and settle
on-chain without exposing PII. A user holds a **Compliance Attestation Token
(CAT)** (a W3C Verifiable Credential bound to a zero-knowledge identity commitment,
**zkDID/humanAnchor**); a platform checks a ZK proof of the CAT against a policy and
issues a scope-bounded **Capability Token (CT)**; each action emits a
transaction-bound **SPT-Txn token**. For inter-VASP transfers it carries a
payload-level **FATF Travel Rule** ZK attestation. No PII on the wire; no native
token; blockchain-agnostic (XRPL is the primary integration target).

> **Status: working, security-audited reference implementation** — not a skeleton,
> and not yet production. Deployed and running on a hardened OpenBSD host with a
> live two-party Travel Rule demo. Twenty chain adapters; attestation-anchor contracts
> live on four public testnets, plus an **on-chain ZK verifier live on Ethereum mainnet** (and two L2 testnets); the
> agentic delegation layer is **POC-built, tested, and now provable in zero
> knowledge**. See [`docs/STATUS`](docs/STATUS.md) for the current-state map,
> [`docs/RUNBOOK.md`](docs/RUNBOOK.md) to reproduce the deployments, and the roadmap
> below for what production still needs.

## What's built and running

- **Real zero-knowledge** — Groth16/BN254 circuits (identity commitment,
  amount-over-threshold, VASP membership), **not stubs**. Hash migrated MiMC →
  **Poseidon2** (benchmarked: −44 % constraints, −41 % prove). `internal/zkproof`,
  `internal/zkhash`, `cmd/zk-setup`, `cmd/zk-bench`.
- **Live FATF Travel Rule** — IVMS101 + selective-disclosure SD-JWT + the three ZK
  predicates, carried over the OpenVASP **Travel Rule Protocol (TRP)** between two
  **separate VASP services** (originator proves, beneficiary verifies with the
  verifying key only). Cleartext-only transfers refused. `internal/travelrule`,
  `internal/trp`, `internal/ivms101`, `internal/vaspregistry`, `cmd/tr-svc`.
- **The token chain** — CAT → CT → SPT-Txn with scope attenuation, bounded
  delegation depth, immutable humanAnchor, 30 s transaction-bound tokens, DPoP
  sender-constraint, and the eight-step offline enforcement engine.
- **Security by design (OpenBSD)** — real `pledge(2)`/`unveil(2)` sandboxing,
  privilege separation, relayd TLS, signify keys; a host-runnable audit at
  **FAIL=0** (`scripts/security-audit.sh`). See `docs/SECURITY-REVIEW.md`.
- **Audit log** with hash-chain + signed Merkle roots; **escrow** envelope for
  lawful deanonymization.
- **Post-quantum-hybrid escrow (implemented)** — the escrow envelope seals
  identities under a hybrid **X25519 + ML-KEM-768** KEM, closing the
  harvest-now-decrypt-later gap. Plus **EO-14409 readiness**: a CycloneDX
  Cryptographic Bill of Materials (`docs/cbom.json`, `docs/CBOM.md`) and a
  lifetime-triaged PQ migration plan.
- **Blockchain-agnostic, multi-chain** — one `Ledger` adapter interface binds an
  authorization to a transaction across **twenty chains** — a single EVM adapter
  serves the EVM L1s and L2s — all tested (see `docs/STATUS.md` for the full list).
  `internal/ledger`. Chains are integration targets, never dependencies.
- **Live on-chain footprints** — attestation-anchor contracts on Ethereum Sepolia,
  Starknet Sepolia, Aptos testnet, and Arbitrum Sepolia (plus a Solana devnet memo
  anchor), each holding a genuine token-derived `ContextHash` — plus a **ZK-verified
  anchor on Ethereum mainnet**. `cairo/`, `move/`, `solidity/`, `cmd/anchor`.
- **On-chain ZK verification** — a gnark Groth16 verifier + `AttestationVerifier`
  wrapper verify a selective-disclosure proof (amount ≥ threshold, amount hidden)
  **on-chain** and anchor only if it checks out — **live on Ethereum mainnet**
  (`AttestationVerifier` `0xb64e2483…46Ab01`), plus Ethereum and Arbitrum Sepolia
  testnets. `cmd/zk-export-solidity`, `cmd/zk-solcalldata`, `solidity/src/`.
- **Compliance-gated RWA token (ERC-3643-aligned, ZK)** — a permissioned
  real-world-asset token whose transfers succeed **only between holders who proved
  eligibility in zero knowledge** — no PII on-chain, just a boolean set by a verified
  proof. Demonstrated end-to-end on **Ethereum Sepolia** (`CompliantRWAToken`
  `0xa382aEb2…F06687`): holders registered via real on-chain proofs, a compliant
  transfer confirmed, a transfer to an unproven address **reverted `NotEligible`**.
  The ERC-3643 permissioned model made privacy-preserving.
  `solidity/src/CompliantRWAToken.sol`, `cmd/rwa-membership-calldata`,
  `docs/RWA-COMPLIANT-TOKEN-SEPOLIA-RUNBOOK.md`.
- **Replay-safe, issuer-bound RWA (V2)** — closes the honest boundary of V1: the
  eligibility proof is now **cryptographically bound to `msg.sender`**, so a valid
  proof lifted from public calldata **cannot be replayed** by another address. Two
  tiers: **Tier 1** binds the holder address as a public input (anti-replay); **Tier 2**
  additionally verifies a **trusted issuer's Baby Jubjub EdDSA signature over the
  holder's address IN-CIRCUIT** (same machinery as F1), making eligibility
  non-transferable and issuer-vetted — the ERC-3643 trusted-issuer role, privacy-
  preserving. Live on **Ethereum Sepolia** (`CompliantRWATokenV2` `0x26a9Ff61…a0cFD`,
  `Mode.IssuerBound`, eligibility verifier `0xca22c5…2bF5b`): two holders registered
  via issuer-bound proofs, a compliant transfer confirmed, a **replayed proof rejected
  `ProofInvalid`**, and a transfer to an unproven address **reverted `NotEligible`**.
  `solidity/src/CompliantRWATokenV2.sol`, `internal/zkproof` (`AddrThresholdCircuit`,
  `EligibilityCircuit`), `cmd/rwa-register-calldata`,
  `docs/RWA-MSGSENDER-BINDING-RUNBOOK.md`.
- **Agentic authorization (POC-tested) + ZK chain proof** — multi-hop CT→CT
  delegation, an offline N-hop verifier, a granular revocation cascade, and a
  Groth16 `ChainCircuit` that proves a delegation chain valid (attenuation, depth,
  human-anchor) **without revealing intermediate scopes**, with an opt-in,
  gnark-free verifier seam. `internal/cttoken`, `internal/verifier`,
  `internal/zkproof`, `cmd/agentdemo`, `cmd/agentsvc`. Designed to enforce inside an **MCP server** as a policy-enforcement point and across **A2A** hops — restoring the human-origin chain that MCP's own token-passthrough rule otherwise severs.
- **Scoped-disclosure SDK + schema** — a request → consent → response protocol for
  time-limited, scope-selected selective disclosure (discloses only requested ∩
  consented). `internal/disclosure`, `docs/DISCLOSURE-SCHEMA.md`.

## Build & test

Go 1.25+, gnark v0.15. The reference deployment runs on OpenBSD; the Go code is
OS-portable (the pledge/unveil layer is behind build tags, with a no-op for
non-OpenBSD). `go build ./...`; `go test ./internal/...`. ZK setup writes circuit
keys via `cmd/zk-setup`.

## Roadmap (honest)

Not production-ready. Agentic AI authorization is now **POC-built and tested**
(multi-hop delegation, offline N-hop verification, granular revocation cascade)
and **provable in zero knowledge**: the `ChainCircuit` verifies each active hop's
registered-issuer signature **in-circuit** (Baby Jubjub EdDSA), alongside
attenuation, depth, and the human anchor — though not yet battle-tested at scale.
Honest gaps that remain: **most on-chain footprints are testnet** — an on-chain ZK
verification is now **live on Ethereum mainnet**; broader mainnet anchoring across chains is next; the open append-only
anchor contracts would want access control or a fee on mainnet; biometric
uniqueness is a placeholder; the `.zkdid`/`.zkdns` production identity/naming layer
is an integration (interim works today); the escrow's post-quantum-hybrid KEM (X25519 + ML-KEM-768) is implemented, while broader PQ migration of TLS and signatures is designed, not yet implemented; and an **independent ZK-circuit + protocol audit** is wanted (the
Arbitrum Audit Fund can subsidize). See [`docs/STATUS.md`](docs/STATUS.md) and the
grant docs for the funded plan.
