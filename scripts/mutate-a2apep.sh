# Mutation check for internal/a2apep -- the A2A Policy Enforcement Point.
#
# internal/decision carries its own mutation coverage; this script covers what
# is NEW here: the wire binding. Which A2A Message fields the intent digest
# covers, which params the PEP will forward at all, and what happens to a
# method it does not model. Every mutation below leaves a middleware that still
# proxies traffic and still answers requests, which is exactly why reading the
# tests is not enough to know they hold.
#
#   A-1  the credential is not stripped before forwarding
#   A-2  metadata is left on the wire as {} after stripping
#   A-3  `parts` leaves the intent binding
#   A-4  `taskId` leaves the intent binding
#   A-5  `contextId` leaves the intent binding
#   A-6  an unmodelled message/* method is proxied instead of refused
#        (killed by the RULE the receipt records, not by the denial: since the
#        read-only allowlist landed, a message/* method that got past that
#        branch is refused by the allowlist a few lines later, so an assertion
#        that only checks "denied" passes with the branch deleted. A-6 survived
#        that way once already.)
#   A-7  an unbound params sibling (configuration) is forwarded
#   A-8  an unrecognised Message member is forwarded
#   A-9  a duplicated Message member is accepted
#   A-10 the jsonrpc version check is dropped
#   A-11 an empty method is proxied
#   A-12 the read-only method allowlist is bypassed
#   A-13 the webhook installer is added to the allowlist
#   A-14 a read-only method stops being observable
#   A-15 the webhook refusal loses its specific rule path
#   A-16 the tier-2 configuration member leaves the intent binding
#   A-17 a tier-3 configuration member stops being accepted
#   A-18 the v1.0 stream method (SendStreamingMessage) loses its rule path
#   A-19 the v1.0 webhook spelling (taskPushNotificationConfig) loses its rule path
#   A-20 the v1.0 role spelling (ROLE_USER) stops being pinned as user
#   A-21 the v1.0 tier-3 member (returnImmediately) stops being accepted
#   A-22 ListTasks (v1.0 enumeration) is added to the read-only allowlist
#   A-23 a credential on the read-only passthrough is forwarded
#   A-24 the read-only params allowlist is bypassed
#   A-25 a v1.0 tenant is admitted to a read's params
#   A-26 the v1.0 method spelling stops reaching the authorization path
#   A-27 a credential outside message.metadata (inside parts) is forwarded
#   A-28 a v1.0 send is forwarded under the v0.3.0 dialect (A2A-Version)
#   A-29 a v1.0 read is forwarded under the v0.3.0 dialect
#
# A-2 RE-ANCHORED 2026-09-06. Its anchor had gone stale when the strip code
# changed from `if len(meta) == 0 { delete }` to refuse-then-delete, so the
# mutation never applied and the script reported "anchor not found" run after
# run. That is not a failing check, it is an ABSENT one: the guard it names had
# no mutation coverage at all while the line stayed red. The mutation now
# re-marshals the emptied map back onto the message, which is the actual A-2
# scenario (metadata surviving as {} rather than being removed), compiles, and
# is killed by the assertion at a2apep_test.go:165.
#
# A-3, A-4 and A-5 mutate the json TAG on the `bound` struct rather than the
# call site. That is deliberate. The test rig mints against the same struct, so
# a mutation at the call site alone would make BOTH sides disagree and every
# request would be denied -- and a test asserting denial would then pass for
# the wrong reason and score as SURVIVED. Mutating the tag moves both sides
# together, which is the honest question: is this field part of the binding?
#
# NOT COVERED BY MUTATION, and why:
#
#   * the agent-identity target binding (TestTokenForAnotherAgentDenied). No
#     single-anchor mutation makes the PEP accept a token minted for another
#     agent without rewriting it to take its identity from the request, which
#     is a redesign, not a mutation. The digest's coverage of `target` is
#     mutation-tested in internal/intent.
#   * the empty-`parts` rejection (TestWellFormedRequestWithEmptyMessageDenied).
#     Removing that guard still denies, because a message with no metadata
#     carries no token. It is defence in depth, and the test says so.
#
# Restores the file on any exit path, including Ctrl-C.
