# Mutation check for cmd/a2a-pep -- the HTTP transport in front of the A2A
# enforcement point.
#
# internal/a2apep and internal/decision carry their own mutation coverage. What
# is new here is the transport: which requests exist at all, what is refused
# before the enforcement point is consulted, what the wrapped agent receives,
# and what the PEP publishes about itself. Every mutation below leaves a proxy
# that still proxies and still answers, which is exactly why reading the tests
# is not enough to know they hold.
#
#   T-1  the JSON-RPC path stops being checked -- POST anywhere is enforced-and-forwarded
#   T-2  GET on the JSON-RPC path is accepted
#   T-3  the Content-Type check is dropped
#   T-4  the request body cap is removed
#   T-5  a request may go unanswered
#   T-6  a refused notification is answered anyway
#   T-8  a streamed answer from the agent is relayed
#   T-9  a redirect from the agent is followed
#   T-10 a non-2xx answer is treated as an answer
#   T-11 the agent card is relayed with no -public-url to advertise
#   T-12 the relayed card keeps the wrapped agent's url
#   T-13 the relayed card keeps additionalInterfaces
#   T-14 the absolute-URL scheme check is dropped (guards -upstream AND -public-url)
#   T-15 -upstream stops being required
#   T-16 a bad tts public key no longer stops startup
#   T-17 the top-level agent-card allowlist is bypassed (a "Url" variant relays)
#   T-18 a v1.0 card's supportedInterfaces is relayed untouched
#   T-19 a non-JSONRPC v1.0 interface is re-advertised instead of dropped
#   T-20 the upstream card's JWS signatures survive the rewrite
#   T-21 a card naming no endpoint in either dialect is relayed
#   T-22 an informational URL member (iconUrl) is relayed
#   T-23 the agent's securitySchemes are relayed
#   T-24 a JSONRPC entry's protocolVersion is copied without a type check
#   T-25 the card-refusal body leaks the reason to the caller
#   T-26 A2A-Version is not set on the forwarded request
#   T-27 an unknown dialect is forwarded (unversioned) instead of refused
#   T-28 an allowlisted card member is relayed untyped (capabilities.streaming)
#   T-29 a skill's security references survive the dropped securitySchemes
#   T-30 preferredTransport survives unrewritten when no url sits beside it
#   T-31 a JSONRPC interface on a version the PEP does not speak is re-advertised
#
# NOT COVERED BY MUTATION, and why:
#
#   * T-7, "no client header reaches the wrapped agent"
#     (TestForward_NoClientHeaderReachesTheWrappedAgent). There is no anchor to
#     mutate, because forward never receives the client's *http.Request: it is
#     handed the token-stripped BODY and nothing else, so there is no header
#     map in scope to copy. The property is structural rather than checked, and
#     that is the stronger form of it. The test is a regression guard aimed at
#     a future refactor -- swapping in httputil.ReverseProxy, or threading the
#     request down to reuse a trace header -- which would put the headers back
#     in scope and reopen the hole in one line.
#
# Restores the file on any exit path, including Ctrl-C.
