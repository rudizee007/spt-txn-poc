Everything below is ready to paste into the Zenodo upload form. The file to upload is
**`docs/spt-txn-framework-expanded-v2.pdf`** (em-dashes thinned, TOC after the abstract,
companion-artifacts line removed; `.docx` alongside if you prefer). I can't publish to your
Zenodo account — you do the final upload + "Publish" — but every field is pre-written here.

## How to publish (recommended path)

This paper is the evolved **framework** paper, so deposit it as a **New version of the
existing framework record** to keep one citable concept-DOI across versions:

1. Go to the framework preprint **10.5281/zenodo.18917439** → **"New version"**.
2. Upload `WORKING-PAPER-v2.pdf` (remove the old file if Zenodo carries it over).
3. Paste the metadata below, set **Version = v2**, **Publication date = 2026-06**.
4. Save → **Publish**. Zenodo mints a new version DOI under the same concept DOI.

(Alternative: if you'd rather it stand alone, create a **New upload** instead — then add
`10.5281/zenodo.18917439` and `10.5281/zenodo.19299787` as *related identifiers* with
relation **"is new version of"** / **"references"** so the lineage is still linked.)

**Description / Abstract** (paste):
```
Every regulated interaction — opening an account, transacting a tokenised asset, authorising an AI agent to act on a person's behalf — today requires identity and eligibility to be re-verified from scratch, at every platform, at a cost of tens of dollars and days of latency per check. The data exhaust of that model is a standing breach liability, and it does not survive the move to autonomous agents, where the accountable human dissolves within one or two delegation hops.

SPT-Txn is an authorization framework that verifies once and proves everywhere. A user holds a Compliance Attestation Token (CAT) — a W3C Verifiable Credential, issued by a regulated KYC/compliance provider, that binds zero-knowledge-provable compliance attributes to a zkDID commitment. A platform evaluates a zero-knowledge proof of the CAT against a representation-agnostic policy object and, on a match, issues a scope-bounded Capability Token (CT); an AI agent receives a strictly attenuated, delegation-depth-bounded CT carrying an immutable humanAnchor back to the accountable person. Each action emits a transaction-bound SPT-Txn token (~30 s lifetime, sender-constrained per DPoP), and every step is recorded to a tamper-evident audit trail. No personally identifiable information is transmitted or stored at the point of use.

The paper covers the full architecture and the design alternatives considered; the cryptographic choices and their measured trade-offs (Groth16 over BN254, MiMC→Poseidon2 migration, BN254 vs BLS12-381); a privacy-preserving FATF Travel Rule deployment (IVMS101 + selective-disclosure SD-JWT + zero-knowledge predicates over the OpenVASP Travel Rule Protocol); a decentralised naming and private-resolution layer (zkDNS); a lifetime-triaged hybrid post-quantum migration plan (FIPS 203/204/205) with a CycloneDX Cryptographic Bill of Materials; and the regulatory/standards context. It is a companion to, and deliberately distinct in scope from, the IETF Internet-Draft draft-coetzee-oauth-spt-txn-tokens. A reference implementation in Go on a hardened OpenBSD host accompanies the paper (open source, Apache-2.0).

## After publishing

- Add the new DOI to the website Publications card and the README.
- Update the IETF I-D's informative references if you cite the framework paper there.
- Use the new version DOI in the XRPL grant form's "links / prior work" field.

## Regenerate the PDF (only if you edit the .md first)

```sh

```
(TOC/abstract order and fonts come from the YAML front matter in the `.md`. The committed
PDF is already current — only needed if the source changes.)
