// Package a2apep is the SPT-Txn A2A Policy Enforcement Point: JSON-RPC
// middleware that wraps an Agent2Agent endpoint so that every message/send
// requires a valid transaction-scoped token whose intent binding matches the
// message being delivered.
//
// It is the sibling of internal/mcppep and shares its decision core
// (internal/decision) unchanged. That is the point: the authorization layer is
// orthogonal to the transport. MCP carries tool calls, A2A carries agent-to-
// agent messages, x402 carries payments; the question "was this actor allowed
// to do exactly this" is the same question in all three, and is answered in one
// place.
//
// Wire binding (A2A specification v0.3.0, and the v1.0 renaming of it):
//
//	method  message/send            (v0.3.0)   SendMessage (v1.0)
//	params  MessageSendParams { message: Message, configuration?, ... }
//	Message { role, parts, messageId, taskId, contextId, metadata }
//	metadata is "{ [key: string]: any }" for extension data, namespaced by an
//	extension-specific identifier.
//
// A2A v1.0 renamed every JSON-RPC method and re-spelled three members this
// PEP inspects (role "user" became "ROLE_USER"; configuration.blocking became
// configuration.returnImmediately; configuration.pushNotificationConfig became
// configuration.taskPushNotificationConfig). Both dialects are accepted, and
// each v1.0 spelling is classified exactly as its v0.3.0 counterpart: the
// authorization question does not change because a method was renamed. Any
// v1.0 member this PEP has not classified (params.tenant, message.extensions,
// message.referenceTaskIds) stays refused by the allowlists below.
//
// The token therefore travels in params.message.metadata["spt-txn/token"], the
// direct analogue of MCP's params._meta["spt-txn/token"], and is STRIPPED
// before the message is forwarded. That position is the ONLY one accepted: a
// send whose request carries the token key anywhere else -- inside a part's
// metadata, inside a data part, inside configuration, at any depth -- is
// refused (rpc.credential-misplaced), not stripped, because everything outside
// message.metadata is either bound into the digest (parts) or allowlisted
// content the agent acts on, and rewriting it would forward something other
// than what was authorized. On the read-only passthrough (observableMethods)
// there is no credential to strip, and a request that carries the token key
// anywhere is refused (rpc.credential-on-passthrough). Under that key, at any
// position, the wrapped agent never sees the credential (docs/THREAT-MODEL.md
// §4.6, confused-deputy discipline). A client that ships its secret under some
// OTHER member name has shipped a string this PEP cannot tell from data; the
// allowlists keep such a string from riding through as an unrecognised member,
// but cannot recognise it as a secret. That is the boundary of the claim.

//
//   - messageId — generated per send by the client. The minter cannot predict
//     it, so binding it would make every token unusable. Replay of a whole
//     message is handled by the decision engine's jti replay window, not here.

//   - metadata  — carries the credential itself, and is stripped before

// observableMethods is the exact set of A2A methods that only READ. Anything

// observation", which assumed that non-message traffic does not act. Only three
// of A2A v0.3.0's ten methods are reads. The rest change state, and one of them
// is a capability grant:
//
//   - tasks/pushNotificationConfig/set installs a client-supplied webhook URL
//     that all subsequent task updates are pushed to, and task updates carry
//     message content. A hijacked or prompt-injected agent does not need to
//     defeat the intent binding on message/send at all: it points the webhook
//     at a host it controls, and every authorized message thereafter is copied
//     out through a method the PEP had classified as observation. This is the
//     defect that forced the rule to change.
//   - tasks/pushNotificationConfig/delete removes one, silencing the operator's
//     own notifications.
//   - tasks/cancel transitions a task to canceled. Calling it is not observing
//     it; it is a denial of service against work already authorized.
//   - tasks/resubscribe reopens a stream this PEP does not model, which is the
//     same objection that refuses message/stream.
//   - agent/getAuthenticatedExtendedCard returns an agent card, and a card
//     names endpoints. cmd/a2a-pep rewrites the well-known card precisely so it
//     cannot advertise the agent behind the enforcement point; passing this
//     method through would republish that bypass over JSON-RPC, where the card
//     rewriter never looks.
//
// A method absent from this map is denied whether or not it existed when this
// was written. That is the property a denylist cannot have, and it is the same
// reasoning that makes allowedSendParams and allowedMessageMembers allowlists.
//
// A second consequence: the observe.passthrough.<method> rule path below now
// only ever concatenates one of these six constants. Under the denylist it
// concatenated attacker-supplied text, giving the receipt log an unbounded
// cardinality of rule paths that an adversary chose the contents of.
//
// A2A v1.0 renamed the three reads and they are listed under both spellings.
// It also ADDED a read this map deliberately omits: ListTasks enumerates every
// task the agent holds, with filters. The v0.3.0 set only ever let a caller read
// a task whose id it already held, and this passthrough is unauthenticated;
// widening it to enumeration would hand an anonymous caller the id of every
// task, and with it the GetTask that reads each one. The new name is a new
// capability, not a rename, and it is denied.
//
// Each entry carries the SHAPE of the params this PEP will forward for it. The
// passthrough used to forward params raw, which made "a read of one task" a
// promise the method name made and nothing checked: a params-level metadata
// (v0.3.0), a tenant (v1.0), or any member added later rode through an
// unauthenticated path uninspected. Now every read's params are allowlisted
// exactly as a send's are, and the member that names the task is required to be
// a non-empty string. That is the property that makes these reads narrower than
// ListTasks: a caller must already hold the id. The v0.3.0 request shapes are
// TaskQueryParams, GetTaskPushNotificationConfigParams and
// ListTaskPushNotificationConfigParams; the v1.0 ones are GetTaskRequest,
// GetTaskPushNotificationConfigRequest and ListTaskPushNotificationConfigsRequest
// (task_id REQUIRED, page_size, page_token). None of the six carries a parent
// or wildcard member in either specification, and none is allowlisted here.
//
// Member names are the lowerCamelCase the A2A specification mandates for every
// JSON serialisation (spec §5.5, "MUST use camelCase"). Proto3's JSON parser
// also accepts snake_case on input, and a hand-rolled client might send it; it
// is refused here, deliberately. Accepting both spellings would double every
// allowlist in this package (the send path is camelCase-only too, and its
// digest is computed over camelCase members) and would need a rule that the
// two spellings of one member never both appear. The specification's MUST is

// docs/spec/DELEGATION-INTENT-A2A.md 4.1. MessageSendConfiguration is not a
// homogeneous field, and treating it as one is the mistake this map prevents.
//
//   - pushNotificationConfig (TIER 1, a capability grant) is ABSENT. It carries
//     a URL and authentication material: the same webhook as
//     tasks/pushNotificationConfig/set, reachable inside a single message/send.
//     A caller who can set it can redirect the results of a message they were
//     authorized to send. A token that authorizes "send this content to this
//     agent" does not authorize "and copy the results to this host". It is
//     refused explicitly, with its own error and its own receipt rule, rather
//     than falling out of this map as a generic unrecognised member -- because
//     it is not a client mistake, it is the shape of an attack.
//
//   - historyLength (TIER 2, a disclosure control) is accepted and BOUND into
//     the intent digest via bound.HistoryLength. Accepted, but not the caller's
//     to choose freely.
//
//   - acceptedOutputModes and blocking (TIER 3, presentation and transport) are
//     accepted UNBOUND. They change how the answer is shaped and whether the
//     call returns immediately; they do not change what the agent does or who
//     sees the result. Refusing them would make this PEP undeployable against
//     ordinary clients for no security gain, which is a real cost and not a
//     conservative choice.
//
//   - returnImmediately is A2A v1.0's replacement for blocking, with the sense
//     inverted (v1.0 blocks by default and this flag opts out). It is the same
//     knob and lands in the same tier for the same reason: it decides whether
//     the caller waits for the task, not what the task does or who sees it. If
//     anything it discloses less, since a call that returns before the task
//     completes returns without the result. A member that is blocking's
//     complement cannot be in a different tier from blocking.
//
// The v1.0 spelling of the tier-1 member, taskPushNotificationConfig, is

// by name in validateSendParams so it gets the webhook rule path rather than
