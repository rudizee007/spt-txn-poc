// Package verifier implements the SPT-Txn eight-step enforcement engine
// (Section 3.3 of draft-coetzee-oauth-spt-txn-tokens) — Milestone 5.
//
// This is the executing domain's (Domain B's) reference verifier. Given a
// presented SPT-Txn Token, a DPoP proof, the parent capability chain, and the
// concrete transaction, it runs eight checks in order and returns allow/deny
// plus the step that decided. Each step is a separate function so failures are
// attributable and unit-testable with golden vectors.
//
// It lives in its own package (not internal/tbac) because it imports the token
// packages, which in turn import tbac — putting the engine in tbac would create
// an import cycle. Nothing imports this package except the Domain B service.

// WHY THIS IS A CONSTRUCTOR AND NOT A FIELD. The binding lives inside a closure
// this package cannot read. Documenting the requirement puts the security
// property in a comment an integrator may not reach — and the type's own comment
// previously explained the CLeaf binding in detail while never mentioning the
// registry root at all. So the property is asserted instead: the verifier is
// exercised against a known-good vector, then once per public input with that
// input perturbed, and every perturbation MUST fail. A closure that ignores an
// input passes the baseline and fails its perturbation, here, at startup, rather
// than in production against a chain it should have rejected.
//
// This is the runtime form of what scripts/mutate-*.sh do in CI: a guard that
// has never been observed failing is indistinguishable from one that cannot.
//
// Groth16 verification is exact in its public inputs, so any perturbation breaks
// the pairing check for a correctly-wired verifier. A perturbation that still
// verifies means that input is not reaching the verification equation.

// keeps granting authority until the ORIGINAL grant expires, which may be
// months. With one, the exposure is capped at the window: the holder must
// re-present a leaf whose lifetime fits inside it.
//
// Set it at or below the status-list TTL. Revocation is not instantaneous on
